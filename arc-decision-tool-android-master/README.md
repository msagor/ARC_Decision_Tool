This project is a mobile app for Android for an American Red Cross division director to input information related to a hurricane event in order to keep track of tasks involved in the response. These tasks are retrieved from the 120 Hours Hurricane Timeline. The tasks are organized according to time remaining and priority. There will be two priorities; high priority tasks involving personal safety of people and normal priority. The application periodically notifies the user of remaining incomplete tasks.
